CLF_ch8 = no zero padding at end
PNE_ch8 = zero padded at end (21400 zeros)
LFP_ch8 = zero padded at end (10940 zeros)

Thus all have 86357 seconds of data, but PNE/LFP extended to 86400 seconds with zeros

When NREM epochs extracted, CLF_ch8 is 27.2ms longer than PNE_ch8 = 8 lfp samples (Mouse MH)

When NREM epochs extracted, LFP_ch8 1948.2ms longer than PNE_ch8 = ~500 lfp samples (Mouse MH)
