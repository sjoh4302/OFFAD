# OFFAD (Off period automated detection)

# What is OFFAD?
OFFAD is an open source signal processing GUI for detecting OFF periods: periods of generalized neuronal silence associated with NREM slow waves. The pipeline consists of a Guassian clustering step followed by a visual and statistical presentation of the resulting OFF periods to allow further curation by the user.
